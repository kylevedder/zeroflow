# How to use this code

## Model weights

Model weights for all trained methods (FastFlow3D and ZeroFlow) and their ablations are provided in their own [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kylevedder/zeroflow_weights).

## File system assumptions

### Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset

Somewhere on disk, have an `argoverse2/` folder so that the downloaded files live inside

```
argoverse2/train
argoverse2/val
argoverse2/test
```

and generate the train and val supervision labels to

```
argoverse2/train_sceneflow
argoverse2/val_sceneflow
```


The [Argoverse 2 Scene Flow generation script](https://github.com/kylevedder/argoverse2-sf) to compute ground truth flows for both `train/` and `val/`.

Please note that when downloaded from the cloud, these files may have a different top level directory format (their stored format keeps changing); you can solve this by moving the files or symlinking the appropriate directories into a different tree. We have uploaded [a prebuilt DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kylevedder/argoverse2_sf/general) for running the generation script.

### Argoverse 2 Tiny Demo Dataset (New!)

To get started, we provide a directly downloadable [tiny demo dataset](https://github.com/kylevedder/zeroflow/files/13059582/argoverse2_tiny.zip) (5.5MB).

`argoverse2_tiny` contains three subfolders:

 - `argoverse2_tiny/val`: a single sequence with the single frame pair
 - `argoverse2_tiny/val_sceneflow`: the supervised ground truth for this frame pair
 - `argoverse2_tiny/val_supervised_out`: the output of the forward pass of our FastFlow3D 1x model on the `configs/fastflow3d/argo/supervised_tiny.py` config with our [supervised checkpoint](https://github.com/kylevedder/zeroflow_weights/blob/master/argo/supervised/supervised.ckpt), i.e.
 
 ```
 python test_pl.py configs/fastflow3d/argo/supervised_tiny.py --checkpoint /efs/sceneflow_golden_weights/argo/supervised/supervised.ckpt
 ```

Visualizing these results with 

```
python visualization/visualize_unsupervised_flow.py 
```

produces the following visualization of the ego vehicle (the center is depicted as the 1m red ball) driving across a bridge with a car driving in the opposite direction.

### Argoverse 2 LiDAR Dataset (For ZeroFlow XL)

Download the full Argoverse 2 LiDAR dataset (WARNING: this dataset is 5.6 _Terabytes_ on disk) so that the downloaded files live inside

```
argoverse2_lidar/train
argoverse2_lidar/val
argoverse2_lidar/test
```

This dataset is enormous, so we subsample it down to the same number of problem pairs as provided by the Sensor train split, while maintaining the data diversity. We do this by taking point cloud pairs at regular intervals across all 20,000 trajectories drawn from the nominal train / val / test splits (NB: none of these sequences are labeled, and the train / val / test splits are notional for e.g. doing occupancy prediction; we simply use them as a homogeneous data source)

To create this subsampled dataset we generate symlinks to the full dataset, treating each frame pair as its own sequence of length 2 so that all of our data loaders work out of the box, using the script:

```
python data_prep_scripts/argo/make_lidar_subset.py <path to argoverse2_lidar> <path to subset folder>
```

### Waymo Open

Download Waymo Open v1.4.2 (earlier versions lack map information) and the scene Flow labels contributed by _Scalable Scene Flow from Point Clouds in the Real World_ from the [Waymo Open download page](https://waymo.com/open/). We preprocess these files, both to convert them from an annoying proto file format to a standard Python format and to remove the ground points.

Do this using 

1. `data_prep_scripts/waymo/rasterize_heightmap.py` -- generate heightmaps in a separate folder used for ground removal
2. `data_prep_scripts/waymo/extract_flow_and_remove_ground.py` -- extracts the points into a pickle format and removes the groundplane using the generated heightmaps

in the Waymo Open docker container.

## Docker Images

This project has three different docker images for different functions.

Each image has an associated convinence script. You must edit this script to modify the mount commands to point to your Argoverse 2 / Waymo Open data locations. The `-v` commands are these mount commands. As an example,

```
-v `pwd`:/project
```

runs `pwd` inside the script, getting the current directory, and ensures that it's mounted as `/project` inside the container. You must edit the `/efs/` mount, i.e.

```
-v /efs:/efs 
```

so that the source points to the containing folder of your `argoverse2/` and `waymo_open_processed_flow/` directories. As an example, on our cluster I have `~/datasets/argoverse2` and `~/datasets/waymo_open_processed_flow`, so if I were to run this on our cluster I would modify these mounts to be

```
-v $HOME/datasets:/efs
```

It's important that, once inside the docker container, the path to the Argoverse 2 dataset is `/efs/argoverse2/...` and the path to Waymo Open is `/efs/waymo_open_processed_flow/...`

### Main image: 

Built with `docker/Dockerfile` [[dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kylevedder/zeroflow)]

Convenience launch script is `./launch.sh`. Make sure that Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open preprocessed are mounted inside a folder in the container as `/efs`.

### Waymo preprocessing image:

Built with `docker/Dockerfilewaymo` [[dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kylevedder/zeroflow_waymo)]. Includes Tensorflow and other dependencies to preprocess the raw Waymo Open format and convert it to a standard format readable in the main image.

Convenience launch script is `./launch_waymo.sh`.

### AV2 challenge submission image:

Built with `docker/Dockerav2` [[dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kylevedder/zeroflow_av2)]. Based on the main image, but includes the [AV2 API](https://github.com/argoverse/av2-api).

Convenience launch script is `./launch_av2.sh`.

## Setting up the base system

The base system must have CUDA 11.3+ and [NVidia Docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker) installed.
